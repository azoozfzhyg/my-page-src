                    Hi this my page using HTML only. though it looks kinda ugly and bland, improvements are on the way. it may take sometime, and there might some ups and downs
                    but this is only the beginning  I will talk about the improvements in details <a href="#improvements" class="no-line">here</a>. <small> yes I'm supposed to talk about my self</small> <br>
                    I'm Abdulaziz Sultan Alotaibi I'm currently a university student and in fact Iam in the last semester.<br>
                    After transfring form the engnineering to Computer Science I got to know some amazing poeple with  a <em>ton</em> and I mean a <em><strong><b>ton</b></strong></em> of experiences and knowledge in different fields
                    in general of specificaly in Computer Sciences.
                    Right know I'm packing my stuff to sail into different worlds and hopefully we might cross roads in happy moments.
                </p>

                    in general I start with making a plan and execute it. if I don't have any information about what I'm trying to achieve I focus on the plan for information gathering. <br>
                    though making a plan is essential it is not everything being flexible and knowing how t juggle alot of tasks at the sametime making priorities and postponing nonurgent tasks is very important. 
                </p>

                            I found this feature on this website <a href="https://unicodesolutions.co">unicodesolutions.co</a> essentially it revereses the color of a tiny circle that follow the cursor automatically.<br>

                            I'm currently learning CSS and I'm planning to use it to make the page more appealing and more interactive.

                        <dt>Adding content</dt>
                        <dd>
                            though it is not necessary it is important to add some flavorful content to the page. <br>
                            pictures background images help.
